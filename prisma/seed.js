      content: `The blog is a detailed introduction to Dynamic memory allocation; starting with pointers, it works its way up to the nub of memory handling. The blog carefully explains the working of pointers, arrays, and their applications
      Pointer Introduction
      A pointer is a variable used to store the address of another variable. Pointers, like other variables, are allocated memory in the memory stack.
      The syntax for declaring a pointer of a specific data type is as simple as,A statement of this syntax declares a pointer of <data_type> with the name,<pointer_name>.
      As said before, the value stored in a pointer is the memory address of another variable. Before starting with a simple code, let's visualize a pointer,
